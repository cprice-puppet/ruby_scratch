    Disable SRV lookups of hosts by default when testing
    
    The old behavior of leaving SRV lookups turned on by default in tests
    was causing problems if the machine running the tests reported itself
    as having a domain name that has SRV records setup for Puppet.  This
    would cause extra calls to Puppet.warning due to the failed connection
    attempts, which could cause a problem if the test was looking
    for specific warnings (which
    spec/unit/indirector/facts/inventory_service_spec.rb does).

      ...
      lastrunfile = /tmp/lastrun.yml { mode=0664 }
      ...

    This commit changes the default file owner to the current user name,
    and the default file group to Nobody, which is the group that Windows
    typically applies to newly created files.

    (#10586) Don't copy owner and group when sourcing files from master
    
    Previously, puppet on Windows was not able to source files from the
    master, because it was attempting to translate the uid/gid from
    the Unix master into a Windows account, and obviously failing.
    
    This commit skips the owner and group properties when copying them
    from non-local sources, i.e. sources whose URIs have a 'puppet'
    scheme.
    
    If the source comes from a local source, then puppet behaves the same
    as it did previously, it copies the owner and group if the source
    volume supports Windows ACLs, e.g. C:/, samba mapped drives, or uses
    default values if the volume does not, e.g. VMware shared drives.

    correctly even if an option doesn't take arguments (giving an argument of true
    if the block takes an argument).

    (#11423) Clearer error message about duplicate imported resources.
    
    When multiple nodes export a resource with a duplicate type and title, and you import both, the error message misleadingly tells you that this was a *local* duplication.
    
    This improves the error message to cover all the bases, which is suboptimal - it should tell you where the duplicate comes from - but at least doesn't lead to a wild goose hunt for the *local* duplicate that doesn't exist.

    Maint: Fix redhatfedorasusecentosslesoelovm in type reference
    
    Many providers are the default for an array of operatingsystem values.
    Although the dochook(:defaults) method was handling multiple defaults already,
    it wasn't handling multiple values for a single default very well, so we would
    say a provider was default for operatingsystem == redhatfedorasusecentosslesoelovm.
    
    This commit refactors that to render arrays of values for a single default as
    a comma-separated list, without breaking the way we handle string values for a
    single default.

    Maint: Padding should be added when dochook strings are consumed, not hardcoded into them
    
    Previously, the return values of the dochook_ methods in provider.rb had a
    leading two-space padding hardcoded into them. This was mostly fine, but had
    the potential to interact badly with semantic Markdown indentation. This
    commit moves the padding into the method where we compose those strings into
    their final position, which gets us some better separation of content and
    formatting.
    
    This commit also changes our display of extra info by giving it its own
    paragraph. Previous behavior was undefined and depended on whether the doc string
    ended with more than one newline; it usually appended the extra info to the
    final paragraph of the documentation.

    (#11404) Fix broken and unreliable indentation in provider lists in type reference
    
    Previously, portions of a provider's documentation string could be wildly
    outdented relative to their surroundings, due to the interaction of some
    inaccurate assumptions; see http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/11404 for
    more details.
    
    This commit fixes these formatting glitches by normalizing the indentation of
    the various fragments we assemble into the provider parameter's doc string. We
    normalize the parameter's @doc explicitly with scrub(), and then we render the
    list of providers as a definition list, which implicitly normalizes indentation.

    Maint: Make indentation for markdown definition lists more readable and reliable
    
    Previously, we indented subsequent lines of definition lists with a four-space
    hanging indent. This ensured that multi-paragraph DD elements would work, but
    was unsightly. This commit changes the hanging indent for definitions to 2
    spaces, which also works but is much more legible before being processed into HTML.
    
    This commit also adds sanitization (via the scrub method) for definition text.
    Since scrub() is idempotent, and since the consequences of text with
    unreliable indentation making it into a DD element are so annoying, it makes
    sense to hedge our bets when creating the element.
    
    Test update included.

    (#11404) Move markdown_header and markdown_definitionlist to Puppet::Util::Docs
    
    The markdown_header and markdown_definitionlist methods are needed in places
    other than the Puppet::Util::Reference class. In particular, they may become
    necessary when assembling fragments of documentation from other fragments,
    much as we need to do for the :provider parameter.
    
    This commit puts them in the Puppet::Util::Docs module, which leaves them
    available when generating the references but also exposes them in many other
    places.

    By including the epoch version in the version returned as the "latest"
    available, we can now properly consider package updates where only the
    epoch version has changed.

    (#6412) Return :undef when accessing non-existing hash/array elements
    
    The truethiness test done in P::P::Scope.true? doesn't handle nil
    values, because it is not valid as result of a puppet expression.
    Unfortunately ruby hash['invalid'] or array[inexistant_index] returns
    nil which then was considered as true in an if expression.
    This patch makes sure :undef is returned in those cases.

    Build a Rake task for building Apple Packages
    
    The goal is to have our release managers build all Puppet packages
    within Rake, and so this commit adds a rake task (apple_package) that
    will build a DMG-encapsulated package for OS X and put it into the
    pkg/apple directory off of the Puppet Root.
    
    To accomplish this goal, a folder structure is created in
    /tmp/puppet/puppet-#{version} that mirrors the structure needed for
    Apple's Packagemaker CLI tool to build a package for OS X. Next, the
    necessary files are copied from the Puppet source into the structure in
    /tmp/puppet/puppet-#{version} and then packagemaker is run
    (targeting that folder structure) to build an initial package. Hdiutil
    then encapsulates that package into a DMG, and the file is finally
    copied into the pkg/apple directory.
    
    Namespace package:apple rake task
    
    To align with the current rake workflow, the action to build an Apple
    package should be namespaced under the package action. This commit does
    that. Checks have also been added to ensure that the package:apple task
    is run as root (which is necessary for OS X) and that the packagemaker
    binary is installed (as its necessary for the task). If neither is true,
    the task will fail sanely (as opposed to a stack trace).
    
    Use git describe to get Puppet version
    
    Using `git describe` over Puppet::PUPPETVERSION to get the current
    Puppet version allows us to pull in the 'RCx' tag which can be used to
    build the package. `git describe` is split on the hyphen ( - ) to remove
    all the additional cruft at the end. Finally, the package minor version
    splits on 'rc' since prototype.plist can only contain integers and not
    string data.
    
    Install into /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby
    
    In order to support 10.4 (which will be dropped in 2.8.x), we must
    install puppet into /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8 as opposed to
    /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8. The prototype.plist file we bundle with the
    package we create sets the IFPkgFlagFollowLinks key to true, so as long
    as the symlink exists the package we build will respect it.
    
    There IS a bug in OS X
    (http://openradar.appspot.com/9202152) where the symlink in
    /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby is incorrect PRIOR to the first time the OS is
    booted, but the symlink gets fixed at first boot. Users who build a
    previously-unbooted-pristine-image of OS X and who also intend to
    install Puppet on that image BEFORE it is booted may need to modify
    their package to target /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8, however we cannot do
    this at this time as OS X 10.4 DOES NOT have a /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8
    folder.

    Don't try to read the body of a file content response twice
    
    Previously, get_file_from_source was calling Net::HTTP#request_get to
    request file content, and yielding the response to
    chunk_file_from_source, which would read the body. However, when called
    without a block, request_get will read the body itself before returning
    the response. This caused an error when chunk_file_from_source then
    tried to read (and inflate if necessary) the body.
    
    Now, get_file_from_source will pass its block along to request_get,
    which will yield the unread response, rather than yielding the result of
    request_get, which is a read response. This prevents a double read
    error, and also allows us to properly inflate the body.

    (#10109) Make resourcefile work with composite namevars
    
    The code for creating the resourcefile was directly calling
    resource.name_var, which was causing problems with resources that have
    composite namevars (since, for these, Type#name_var will return false).
    This patch sanitizes the process by first checking whether there is a
    single namevar, and simply calling resource.ref if there is not one.

    (#11246) Add README_DEVELOPER describing UTF-8 in Puppet
    
    Without this patch, developers of Puppet don't have a clear place to get
    a high level understanding of the way other Puppet developers are
    working with UTF-8 and the differences in character encodings between
    Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.
    
    This patch addresses this problem by adding a new document,
    README_DEVELOPER.md where developers and contributors can look to for
    high level information.

    (#7110) Better SSL error message certificate doesn't match key
    
    Previously, any error with the certificate retrieved from the master
    matching the agent's private key would give the same static error
    message, which wasn't particularly helpful. This commit differentiates
    three different error cases: missing certificate, missing private key,
    and certificate doesn't match private key. In the last case, the error
    message includes the fingerprint of the certificate in question and
    explicit command line instructions on how to fix the problem.
    
    In addition to all tests passing, I tested the error messaging and
    included instructions in a virtual machine setup running PE 2.0.0.

    (#11276) Mark module tool tests as failing on Windows
    
    Until we can deal with the module tool's reliance on tar, either by
    recommending a tar installation for windows or not needing to, the
    module tool won't work on windows and I'm marking the specs accordingly.
    `puppet module search` currently works on windows, but it's one of the
    few actions that doesn't deal with tar files.

    (#11273) Updates init.pp.erb for style guide.
    
      This patch introduces a more thorough init.pp template that outlines
      what parameters and variables are, a spot for Author, and Copyright;
      to be used when a new module skeleton is generated using the puppet
      module face.  Content is based on recommended puppet doc format, suggested by
      the official style guide.  Plus a few fix ups in syntax.  In testing this
      template I found errors in our style guide and will be pushing a branch to fix
      that recommendation too.

    (#11198) Modulefiles should have a default license
    
    Before this patch, the module generate action generates Modulefiles
    with the license set to UNKNOWN, which is not a valid license.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by setting the default value of the
    `Puppet::Module::Tool::Metadata#license` attribute to 'Apache License,
    Version 2.0' by default. This patch also adds a new unit test verifying
    this this change.

    (#11246) Fix UTF-8 String#to_yaml exception
    
    Without this patch, String instances with an encoding of UTF-8 cannot be
    serialized to YAML.  The method that coverts non-ascii 8bit printable
    bytes to escape sequences uses regular expressions to match specific
    bytes in the string.  This works fine in Ruby 1.8, but Ruby 1.8 adds
    encodings to Regexp and String instances.  This is a problem because
    regular expressions of one encoding may not work with Strings of another
    encoding.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by ensuring Regexp's clearly assuming a
    byte sequence rather than a character sequence used in the YAML
    serialization process are given an ASCII-8BIT encoded string.
    
    A new helper method String#to_ascii8bit is added by this patch to make
    Ruby 1.8 support easier.  None of this matters with Ruby 1.8 so the
    helper method simply returns the string itself.  If the String does have
    an encoding, but it's already ASCII-8BIT the helper also returns the
    string itself.
    
    In the case the String has an encoding and it's not a byte sequence with
    ASCII-8BIT encoding, we make a duplicate of the string so we can force
    the encoding.  The duplicate is necessary so we don't change the
    encoding of the original string.  For extremely large strings this may
    be an issue and other strategies may be necessary.

    (#10064) Add the Puppet environment to reports
    
    Previously the Puppet environment was not included in
    the report output. Using the model of how configuration_version
    was added to the reports the environment will now also be reported.
    
    Puppet::Transaction::Report now takes three arguments:
    
    * Kind of report
    * Configuration version
    * Environment
    
    Tests for this have been added and existing tests updated.
